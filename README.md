# Monophobia 1

**So, what is Monophobia 1?**
Monophobia is a game that I made in RPG Maker VX Ace, originally planned to be a test to see how far I could push the limits of the engine, went to be a full-fledged ARG story that was planned for 4 years ever since I was a 12 years old. It was teased in form of me showcasing intentionally cancelled games and its screenshots to a private server with me and my ex-friends. The original version was released in 09/17/2021 and development lasted a month.

**Was the ARG solved?**
Yes, by a couple of people.

**Will there be any more updates to the game?**
Maybe, now that I need to fit in the story from Monophobia 2 to Monophobia 1, I might add in more updates, as for now however, v1.4 is the final version of the game.

**This is too hard for me! I can't figure it out, I need some sort of walkthrough!**
Say no more. https://pastebin.com/1FZcYkKF
